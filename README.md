# understanding-computer-programming

A few of my co-workers have expressed an interesting in understanding the fundamentals of programming.  As a professional programmer of more then 20 years who'd like to understand law and finance better, the idea of trying to put programming into perspective for others appeals to me.

My idea was to start with HTML even though it's not a programming language, just a markup language, because it's easy for people to relate to HTML today.  The transition from HTML to Javascript should be simple for most people, and this approach should allow any student with a browser and a keyboard to experiment, no compilers or other environmental setup is necessary.
